## Project Description

GINDER is a personalized chatbot that finds open-source companies for you to contribute to, based on a thorough analysis of your own repositories.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Your GitHub Account:** Log in to GINDER and grant permission to read the code in your repositories.
2. **Analyze & Match:** GINDER will analyze the languages and frameworks you use most often. It then cross-references this information with a large database of open-source companies.
3. **Get Recommendations:** Within minutes, GINDER generates a list of the top repositories that align with your experience, helping you find meaningful open-source contributions.
