## Project Description

GINDER is a personalized chatbot that finds open-source companies for you to contribute to, based on a thorough analysis of your own repositories.

## How It Works

**Connect Your GitHub Account**  
Log in to GINDER and grant permission to read the code in your repositories.

**Analyze & Match**  
GINDER will analyze the languages and frameworks you use most often. It then cross-references this information with a large database of open-source companies.

**Get Recommendations**  
Within minutes, GINDER generates a list of the top repositories that align with your experience, helping you find meaningful open-source contributions.
